       <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
       <div class="abs">
           <p id="abstract">Moderating toxicity in streaming platforms like YouTube can be challenging. In recent years, there are only few studies that have analyzed toxicity in streaming platforms. Additionally, because toxicity can manifest differently on different social networking platforms, the definition for toxicity could differ and be unclear, which makes modeling toxicity for automated detection and analysis even more difficult. In our study, we built a corpus for toxic texts in live stream chat logs. First, we defined Toxic Communication and identified labels to categorize the chats. We then collected 257,110 chat messages from News and Gaming YouTube channels and annotated 53,745 chat messages with toxic and harassment labels. Next, we extracted insights from the data by extracting TF-IDF, POS features, topics and performing correlation analysis. Based on word content and extracted topics, toxicity may include some form of harassment, profanity or negative interjection. Although the concept of harassment cannot entirely describe toxicity, our study found some relationship between toxicity and harassment in the News and Gaming genre of live streams. The results of our study provide knowledge in understanding how toxicity appear in live stream chats, and also help future researchers to further explore and analyze Toxic Communication in live streaming platforms.</p>

        <h4>Research Overview</h4>

            <p id="rText">The figure above describes the flow of our research. In summary, our research has a total of three major steps.
                The first major step is the Review of Related Literature. In this phase, we review previous studies on Toxic Communication
                , Corpus Development, and Information Extraction. These studies were used to guide our research. In the next phase, we
                focused on the development of the Corpus. This phase was broken down into different steps: Data Collection, Data Cleaning, and
                Data Annotation. After the completion of the development of the corpus, we proceeded to the next phase, Corpus Analysis and
                Evaluation. This phase consists of the analysis of the developed corpus. This involves getting the kappa scores and utilizing
                existing NLP analysis techniques.
